        <p>Education 3.0 is a more of a heutagogical, connectivist approach to teaching and learning. Education 3.0 can be described by the “C’s” of education - Creativity, Critical thinking, Competency, Content, Classes, Calculation, Communication, Compelling Questions, Care, Cognition, Challenge, Computer literacy, Context, Culture, and much more. The teachers, learners, networks, connections, resources, media, tools etc create a unique entity that has the potential to satisfy individual learners', teachers’, and even schools’ needs.

We at EduStine Technologies follow a very innovative approach towards content preparation that is based on academic and pedagogical research, and proven scientific facts as mentioned below:

</p>

        <h1>Micro Learning</h1>

        <p>- Microlearning focuses on providing learning in short bursts of time (3-5
minutes), and includes learning activities that can be quickly completed. Students have to digest
only small chunks of information and According to the Journal of Applied Psychology, learning in
bite-sized pieces relaxes the mind and the transfer of learning is approximately 20 % more
efficient and effective. Attention span of the students’ is on continuous decline and now it has
come down to 4-7 mins from approx 15 mins 10 years ahead. Research says that Learning in
stretches of 3-7 minutes matches the working memory capacity and attention spans of humans.</p>

       
        <h1>Interactive Engaging Contents</h1>

        <p>According to studies, small nuggets of information are easier to
remember and recall whenever needed. Our Microlearning lessons are structured in a certain
way to expose the learners to bite-sized lessons with continuous interactions, immediately
followed by practice quiz capsule for reinforcement. This format results in higher retention as
compared to others. According to a report well designed Microlearning creates 50% more
engagement of students.</p>

	<h1>Text and Images</h1>
	<p>Research says that text with graphics produces 55 – 115 % better results while solving the problems. Videos are very good to explain concepts but takes a lot of time and ceases the power of imagination. At the same time videos takes a lot more time in revising the things compared to text and cannot be used for recalling. Also the monotony of videos could lead in losing the interest of students.</p>

	<h1>Not just revision point, well connected - storytelling - free flow contents</h1>
	<p> Harvard review says that learning which stems from a well-told story is remembered more accurately, and for far longer, than learning derived from facts and figures.  Stories help us retain information better than drab bits of information. They can be a compelling way to highlight specific learnings, which can motivate learners to engage with the content on a deeper level psychologist Jerome Bruner’s research suggest that facts are 20 times more likely to be remembered if they’re part of a story.
</p>

	<h1>Confirms to the 20:80 revision rule</h1>
	<p>Parote’s 20:80 rule is applicable to retention as well. According to research, we forget about 80% of what we learn daily. If things are revised and recalled in a timely manner then it improves retention a lot. Well planned and In-synch revision methodology helps revising the contents in most scientific fashion and helps improving the performance.
</p>

	<h1> Recall is much more powerful than just revision</h1>
	<p>Just revising the things is Passive Learning whereas recalling is Active Learning. It is much easier to just go through the pages of notes and carry an impression “yes I know this”, than answering random questions in between. In the exam students don’t get marks for being familiar, they get marks for recalling relevant information and using it to answer the question. Prof John Dunlovsky, of Kent State University reviewed 1,000 scientific studies looking at 10 of the most popular revision strategies and found only two techniques effective - testing yourself (recalling) and spreading out your revision over time (well timed) . Leading researchers in the field of memory consider testing yourself as one of the most effective ways to improve your ability to recall information
</p>

	<h1>Foundation to school 3.0 and blended learning </h1>
	<p> Education 3.0 is the coming together of creativity, outcomes, critical thinking, big data, personalization, and much more. It’s really the confluence of three crucial education elements: Neuroscience, Cognitive (Learning) Psychology, and Education Technology. Despite of all the efforts and initiative we are finding it difficult to migrate to Education 3.0 and implement contemporary pedagogies. There is a strong need to create and interweave the different content elements such that it facilitates blended learning, flipped classes and school 3.0.</p>

	<h1>Completely in-synch with the school</h1>
	<p> One of the key approach element of our philosophy is synching the contents with the class. It helps school and teacher to keep the entire control and at the same time provides all the flexibility and personalization for performance improvement.</p>

	<h1>Emotional and Social Encouragement</h1>
	<p>Offering valuable rewards to the learners and recognizing their progress on their journey of learning helps improving the performance of each one. This gives them a sense of accomplishment and acts as a booster dose during the learning progress.</p>
